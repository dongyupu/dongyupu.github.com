### About the Control Chart
* The Control Chart shows the Cycle Time (or Lead Time) for your product, version, or sprint. It takes the time spent by each issue in a particular status (or statuses), and maps it over a specified period of time. The average, rolling average, and standard deviation for this data are shown.

* A Control Chart helps you identify whether data from the current sprint can be used to determine future performance. The less variance in the cycle time of an issue, the higher the confidence in using the mean (or median) as an indication of future performance.

* Here are some of the ways that you could use a Control Chart:

  * Analyze your team's past performance in a retrospective,
  * Measure the effect of a process change on your team's productivity,
  * Provide external stakeholders with visibility of your team's performance, and
  * For Kanban, use past performance to set targets for your team.

### Viewing the Control Chart
  * 1.Navigate to your desired board.
  * 2.Click Reports, then select Control Chart.
  * 3.Configure the chart as desired. The screenshot at the top of this page highlights the controls that you can use to configure the Control Chart.
