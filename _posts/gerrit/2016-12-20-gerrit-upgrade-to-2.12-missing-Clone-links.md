## when gerrit upgrade to 2.12 missing Clone links

* i don't know why the default config is no for the core plugin to gerrit download-commands.jar

* [Issue 3757: Clone links are missing since updating to 2.12](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3757)

* just need to install the download commands plugin (which comes with the core)
