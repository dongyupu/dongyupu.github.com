*   Achieve agility and control for Development and IT Operations teams to build, ship, and run any app, anywhere

*Agility*

*   Docker gives developers the freedom to define environments, and create and deploy apps faster and easier, and flexibility for IT ops to quickly respond to change.

*Control*

*   Docker enables developers to own all the code from infrastructure to app, and the manageability for IT ops to standardize, secure and scale the operating    environment.

*Portability*

*   Docker gives you choice without complexity, from a laptop to a team, to private infrastructure and public cloud providers.
